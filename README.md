# 🛡️ Official Sites Directory - Prevent Malware

A comprehensive directory of **verified official websites** designed to protect users from malware, viruses, and phishing scams. Instead of searching Google (which may show fake or malicious sites), users can access legitimate official websites directly through verified links.

**The Problem:** Fake websites and malicious links can infect your device, steal your data, or trick you into scams.

**The Solution:** Every link in this directory is verified to point directly to the official, legitimate website - never a copycat or malicious site.
